Babysitter Wizard - This solution was created by Amir Golan 2020

This program calculates the nightly charge for a babysitter work.
The program expects to receive three rates as specified in the Babysitter Kata challenge.
Please note that these rates can be easily changed by passing different values to the VarRateBabysitterFactory constructor.
If the rate value is not a positive number, the program will escalate with the right message.
When needed, the code will adjust the start time and end time to reflect the work schedule requirements
The nightly charge is computed by using a calculator object which is injected into the Babysitter constructor. 
The program was designed with code flexibility in mind. 

Please use the following command to compile the program: (make sure that you in the src directory)

BabysitterKataAmir\src>javac -classpath . WorkAppWizard.java

Then, do: BabysitterKataAmir\src>java WorkAppWizard
